# sensAI for RNN

We modified the original sensAI to support RNN models like RNN, LSTM and GRU. We put our implementation in the following branches:
1. nameLan_RNN: This branch contains our implementaion of sensAI on RNN for varied-length time series tasks. Note that this implementation is for Name-Nationality classification dataset. You might need to write your own data processing code and dataloader for your customized dataset.

2. nameLan_LSTM: This branch contains our implementaion of sensAI on LSTM for varied-length time series tasks. Note that this implementation is for Name-Nationality classification dataset. You might need to write your own data processing code and dataloader for your customized dataset.

3. LSTM-Cifar10: This branch contains our implementation of sensAI on LSTM for fixed-length time series tasks. Note that this implementation is for cifar dataset. You might need to write your own data processing code and dataloader for your customized dataset.

4. gru: This branch contains our implementation of sensAI on GRU for fixed-length time series tasks. Note that this implementation is for cifar dataset. You might need to write your own data processing code and dataloader for your customized dataset.


The detailed instructions on how to run our code can be found in the README.md under each branch we mentioned above.
